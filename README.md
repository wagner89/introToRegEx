9. When not to use RegEx

  a. When there is a more readable solution
     Example: check if a string is lowercase

     `var isLowercase = myString === myString.toLowerCase();`

     instead of

     `var isLowercase = /^[a-z]*$/.test(myString);`
     
   b. When the regular expression is costly
     Example: check if a string is lowercase

     `var isLowercase = myString === myString.toLowerCase();`

     instead of

     `var isLowercase = /^[a-z]*$/.test(myString);`
